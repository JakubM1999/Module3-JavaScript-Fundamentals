<h1>MODULE3-JavaScript-Fundamentals</h1>

I decided to create this JS file in VSCode and then push it to github 
repository, I can say that I understand this basic functions of JavaScript and I learned alot ofcorse there is still alot to learn but I
would say that this is a good begining. You can run this code in your VSCode or repl.it and check it out.
